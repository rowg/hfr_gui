The Short And Sweet Of It...
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NetCDF-4 support is added as of R2010b.

Please add this directory to your matlab path.  You must also have 
mexnc on your path in order for snctools to work.

SNCTOOLS is only supported on R14 or higher.  It will not work on
MATLAB versions below R14.


+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SNCTOOLS Preferences

USE_JAVA 
    If you have the toolsUI jar file on your javapath, then enabling
    this preference allows the java backend to work.  You may find this
    useful in reading OPeNDAP URLs, GRIB2 files, or netCDF-4 files 
    (see below).  
    
        setpref('SNCTOOLS','USE_JAVA',true);

    If you wish to use an opendap-enabled version of mexnc, you should
    set this preference to false.

PRESERVE_FVD
    Way back in the old days, when mexnc/mexcdf was the only game
    in town, data was always transposed when reading/writing netCDF
    data thru MATLAB.  The reason for this was seemingly to make the
    data look consistent with the way that the netcdf tools such as
    "ncdump" presented the metadata.  "ncdump" is compiled in C, so
    it is therefore a row-major-order application, whereas MATLAB 
    presents data in column-major order.
    
    Transposing large datasets can be a costly operation, however, and
    it really isn't necessary in all cases.  SNCTOOLS can be told to
    not transpose data by setting the PRESERVE_FVD preference

    >> setpref('SNCTOOLS','PRESERVE_FVD',true);

    By default this preference is false.  If you set it to true,
    you may see a big performance boost for large datasets, but you
    might also end up breaking existing code that expected the data
    to be permuted to row-major order, so you need to be careful
    when using this.

USE_STD_HDF4_SCALING 
    The CF conventions differ from HDF4 in how scale factors are
    to be applied; check their respective references for details.
    By default, HDF4 datasets are scaled according to CF conventions,
    but setting this preference to true forces NC_VARGET to use
    standard HDF4 conventions.  This preference is only useful when
	reading HDF4 data (obviously), it has no effect upon netCDF I/O.

SNCTOOLS and NetCDF-4

SNCTOOLS supports netCDF-4 files under certain conditions...

    You have MATLAB version R2010b or better.  If this is the case,
    then you don't need to do anything, you are already set to go.

    If you have R2010a or earlier versions of MATLAB, then netCDF-4
    support falls into one of two cases.  If you just need to read
    netCDF-4 files, you can do that by enabling the java backend.
    Go to http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/ and make
    sure you download version 4.1 or higher.  Add the jar file to
    your MATLAB path with

        >> javaaddpath ( '/path/to/netcdfAll-4.1.jar' );

    You should then set the needed preference to tell SNCTOOLS to
    enable the java backend with

        >> setpref ( 'SNCTOOLS', 'USE_JAVA', true );

    This also gives you read access to opendap data, so it's a good idea
    whether you need netCDF-4 support or not.

    And the last option is to compile a netcdf4-enabled mexnc mex-file.
    If you do this, SNCTOOLS will automatically use it.

BUG Reports You Should Know About

1)  Experimental GRIB2 Support

     If you have the netcdf-java jar file on your matlab javaclasspath,
     you can try read GRIB2 files as if they were netcdf files.  This is
     a bit experimental, though.  And if your version of MATLAB is R2008a
     or below, you should take a look at Technical Solution 1-2Z4RS7 on
     the Mathworks web site, http://www.mathworks.com.  This describes a
     workaround for dealing with a conflict with the ucarunits.jar file
     that used to ship with MATLAB until R2008b.  As of March 25, 2010,
     the URL for this technical solution was at

     http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-2Z4RS7/?solution=1-2Z4RS7

2)  Empty Attributes

    MATLAB versions R2008b thru R2009b incorrectly disallowed the creation
    of empty attributes, which are quite clearly legal.  The bug is
    fixed in 2010a, but fixes for 2008b thru 2009b are available.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Of all the routines in this m-file collection, the most useful (in my
humble opinion) are as follows
    
    1. nc_varget    - reads a netcdf variable
    2. nc_varput    - writes to a netcdf variable
    3. nc_attget    - reads a netcdf attribute
    4. nc_attput    - writes a netcdf attribute
    5. nc_padheader - pads header section of large netCDF-3 files 
    6. nc_dump      - prints netcdf metadata

There is a subdirectory called "tests" which has routines that test
the m-files of SNCTOOLS.  You really don't need to worry about this
unless you are convinced that there is something wrong with one of
the m-files.  In that case, you can run the test suite by changing
directories into "tests" and running "test_snctools" from the matlab
command line.   You should not run the test suite unless you have matlab
version 2007b or later.
